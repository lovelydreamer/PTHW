# exercise 10:
    '''
        What does \ do?
        What does \n do?
        Tell me what happens here:
             "I "understand" joe."
        what about \t ?
        Combine %r with double-quote and single-quote escapes and print them out. 
        Compare %r with %s. 
        Notice how %r prints it the way you'd write it in your file, but %s prints it the way you'd like to see it?

    '''
        What is a prompt?
        How do I make one?
        In Terminal where you normally run python to run your scripts, type pydoc raw_input. What did you see?
        Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys.
        What does %r vs %s do? How are they different? How are they similar?
